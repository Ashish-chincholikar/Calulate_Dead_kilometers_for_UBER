## **Business Understanding**

Develop a system that can analyze historical trip data of Uber drivers to identify instances where drivers have deviated from their assigned routes. The system will detect these deviations, quantify them against established thresholds, and calculate appropriate fines for drivers who exceed the allowable limits.

### **Objectives:**
1. Boost overall business performance while maintaining fairness and trust between the drivers and the company.
2. Calculate the Dead Kilometers and penalize the drivers if it exceeds a certain limit.

### **Maximize:**
1. The accuracy of Dead Kilometers detection.
2. Driver retention.
3. Profit maximization.
4. Customer satisfaction.

### **Minimize:**
1. Dead kilometers.
2. Operational costs associated with Dead Kilometers.

## **Concept of Dead Kilometers**

### **Definition:**
Dead kilometers refer to the distance traveled by a driver between the drop-off location of one trip and the starting point of the next trip without a passenger. These kilometers represent inefficient utilization of resources, as the driver is not earning during this travel time.

### **Cause:**
Dead kilometers typically occur when a driver finishes a trip and needs to find another ride, leading to idle time where fuel is consumed without generating revenue.

## **Technologies Used**

1. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
3. **Gmplot**: A library for plotting data on Google Maps, useful for geospatial visualizations.
4. **Geopy**: A library used for calculating distances between geographic coordinates.
5. **OS**: Used for interacting with the operating system, such as accessing file paths.
